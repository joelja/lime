Layer Independent OAM Management in the Multi-Layer Environment (LIME)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Network Operators have been increasingly challenged with operational 
   and management limitations in typical network deployments due to 
   siloed Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) in 
   different administrative and technology layers. This problem is 
   exacerbated by the lack of a common architectural approach to OAM 
   tools in those different layers. New work on network virtualization 
   further complicates the layering model and the problems of 
   coordinating OAM between layers.

   The absence of a common approach to OAM and to the management 
   interfaces for OAM has made it very difficult for operators to:

   • Suppres large numbers of unnecessary alarms and notifications 
     related to defects and failures arising in lower layers and visible 
     in each higher layer
   • Quickly identify root causes of network failures
   • Coordinate end-to-end performance measurement with the results of 
     performance monitoring at different layers in the network
   • Correlate status defects, faults, and network failures between the 
     different layers to improve efficiency of defect and fault 
     localization and provide better OAM visibility.

   The LIME working group will concentrate on the operational challenges 
   in consistent handling of end-to-end OAM and coordination of OAM 
   within underlying network layers. This work will enable consistent 
   configuration, reporting, and presentation for the OAM mechanisms 
   used to manage the network, regardless of the layers and 
   technologies. It will also produce architectural guidelines for the 
   development of new OAM tools and protocols so that they may be 
   coherent with these mechanisms and more easily integrated across 
   layers.

   The working group will work on the following deliverables:

   • YANG data models for generic layer-independent and technology-
     independent configuration, reporting and presentation for OAM 
     mechanisms. Information models may also be produced if they are 
     useful to the working group in performing this task.

   • An architecture for new IETF OAM that can be used as guidance by 
     other working groups developing new OAM protocols or modifying 
     existing OAM protocols at any layer and for any technology that is 
     within scope for the IETF. The initial scope is restricted to a 
     single administrative domain and may be extended for inter-domain 
     scenarios in future as and when a need rises.

   The working group may also produce a document describing use-cases 
   for converged management of OAM in multi-layer and multi-technology 
   networks. The use cases will consider both the case of a centralized 
   control point for all OAM, and devolved per-layer control points.

   The working group will not develop any new OAM protocols.

   The LIME WG is not chartered to work on information or data models 
   specific to any data plane or forwarding plane technology that is 
   developed outside of the IETF. However, it is the intention that the 
   generic information and data models produced by the working group 
   should be applicable to multiple layers and technologies in a 
   technology agnostic fashion. Therefore, it is anticipated that the 
   working group will closely coordinate its activities with other SDOs 
   (including, but not limited to the ITU-T, IEEE, and BBF) to ensure 
   that the generic models are harmonized with work done in those SDOs 
   and are applicable to many technologies.
