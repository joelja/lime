1.  Introduction

   This document discusses use-cases for layer independent OAM
   management that would interface to multi-layer or multi-domain
   networks to cover various heterogeneous networking technologies.

   As operators and providers (e.g., network operators, data center
   operators, service providers, etc.) continue to deploy and operate
   multi-layer networks using a wide range of transport technologies,
   layer independent OAM Management for stitching different layer OAMs
   is desirable to minimise operational complexity and simplifying O&M
   (OAM and O&M are used as specified in [RFC6291]).

   This document discusses Layer Independent OAM in Multi-Layer
   Environment (LIME), and is intended to: 

   o  outline use cases for layer independent OAM management
      and highlight the issues encountered with existing OAM 
      protocols;
      
   o  discuss OAM requirements for when designing and deploying new 
      technologies;

   o  outline eixsting technologies to facilitate layer independent OAM 
      management, including MEF work, ITU-T work, IETF related work;

   o  discuss how OAM might be configured via a unified management
      interface:

      *  Establishment of OAM Entities(e.g., MEG, ME,MIP,MEP) and
         Functions(e.g.,CC,CV)

      *  Adjustment of OAM Parameters

      *  Deleting OAM Entities

   o  highlight a generic OAM Management model that may be applied to
      various OAM technologies:

      *  Defining common objects and relationships model for various
         technologies

      *  Defining a common set of methods/calls to use for the various
         functions

      *  Defining a common set of attributes per object

      *  Defining a common set of alarms and notifications

      Specific OAM technology models will augment the basic OAM
      management model defined by the LIME Group.

   o  detail OAM fault management(e.g., fault location, path
      discovery) data model using layer independent OAM Management:

      *  Propose means to help during service diagnosis; these means may
         rely on filtering information so that time recovery can be
         optimized.  A typical example would be efficient root cause
         analysis that is fed with input from various layers.

      *  Propose means that would help to optimize a network as a whole
         instead of the monolithic approach that is specific to a given
         layer.  For example, investigate means that would help in
         computing diverse and completely disjoint paths, not only at
         the overlay but also at the underlay.

   o  discuss the security model for layer independent OAM management:

      *  Propose means to avoid leaking OAM information to no authorized
         entities, and to avoid altering OAM information exposed by each
         layer.

      *  Propose means to ensure reliability of OAM information exposed
         by each layer.

   These requirements are not frozen; further discussion is required to
   target key issues and scope the work to be conducted within IETF
   accordingly. 

   The problem statement and architecture is discussed in [LIME-PS].

3.  Position in the ABNO architecture

   Layer independent OAM in Multi-Layer Environment (LIME) requirement 
   in relation to the OAM Handler functional component, as discussed in 
   the [I-D.farkingell-abno] framework and architecture document.

   The following figure highlights key functional components, including 
   the OAM Handler, within the ABNO architecture:

                +----------------------+--------------------+-+
               /                    Network                    \

                       Figure 1: The ABNO Architecture

   The role of the ABNO OAM Handler is to provide coordination of OAM
   within the ABNO architecture.  These may include correlation of the
   network and service status, performance monitoring, troubleshooting,
   and in some cases reactive action notification of faults or service
   degradation.

   Due to the multi-layer and multi-technology capability of the ABNO
   framework, and subsequent architectures.  It would be highly
   beneficial to provide the capability of representation and
   abstraction of underlay network resources and service information.
   These requirements are further discussed in the following sections.

4.  Layer Independent OAM Management Use Cases

4.1.  Multi-layer multi-region OAM Consolidation in the Management Plane

   A multi-layer multi-region network will often require data traffic
   between two customer edges to be transported across two regions, as
   illustrated in figure 2.  In this scenario the same domain and
   multiple layer OAMs(i.e.,PW OAM,end to end LSP OAM, segment LSP OAM)
   are used.

   For PW OAM is used at the customer level for monitoring the end-to
   -end connection between the two Provider edges(PEs), while end to end
   LSP OAM and segment LSP OAM is used at the provider level for
   monitoring the segment LSP and end to end LSP respectively.  A
   segment is between MEPs and The OAM in each segment is independent of
   any other segment.

                     o  Maintenance Endpoint(MEP)
                     D  Maintenance Intermediary point (MIP)

                  Figure 1: Multi-Region Multi-Layer OAM

   With single OSS/NMS in the management plane, customized service
   diagnose can be provided, e.g.,

   o  initiating tests on any layer in the multi-layer network

   o  initiating test on any segment of the end to end path

   o  initiate test on end to end path

   o  check end-to-end connectivity test results across a multi-layer
      network even when each layer runs a different technology.

4.2.  Multiple layer OAMs stitching in different part of the network

   Figure 2 illustrates a multi-layer network in which data traffic
   between two access nodes is transported through access section
   between access node(AN) and aggregation node(AGG Node) and
   aggregation section between aggregation node and edge node and even
   core section from edge node to Internet or WAN.  EFM OAM is used at
   the access section for monitoring the access connection between the
   access node and aggregation node, CFM OAM and IP OAM is used at the
   aggregation section for monitoring end to end connection between
   aggregation node and edge node.  BFD is used at the core section for
   monitoring end to end connection from edge node to Internet or WAN.

                                 Figure 2

   With single OSS/NMS in the management plane, different layer OAM at
   the different part of the network can be stitching together to
   provide unified view for network problem reporting by consuming all
   status reports from the network, aggregating them, correlating them.

   In addition, a user who wishes to issue a IP Ping Command or use
   connectivity verification command in the Ethernet layer can do so in
   the same manner regardless of the underlying protocol or transport
   technology.  This can be achieved by invoking IP Ping Command or
   connectivity verification command through uniform interface between
   management plane and data plane.  Consider a scenario where an IP
   ping to Edge node B from Aggregation node A failed.  Between AGG node
   A and Edge Node B there are IEEE 802.1 [IEEE-802.1Q] bridges a,b and
   c.  Let's assume a,b and c are using [IEEE-802.1ag] CFM.  IP layer
   Ping can be invoked using uniform interface between single OSS/NMS
   and AGG node A.  Upon detecting IP layer ping failure, the user may
   wish to "go down" to the Ethernet layer and issue the corresponding
   fault verification (LBM/LBR) and fault isolation (LTM/LTR) tools,
   using the same uniform interface used by IP Layer Ping.

4.3.  Stitching OAM at layer requiring L4 to L7 service

   In Service Function Chain ([I-D.ietf-sfc-problem-statement]), the
   service packets are steered through a set of Service Function
   distributed in the network.  Overlay technologies and other tunneling
   techniques can be used to stitch these Service Function Nodes in
   order to form end to end path (see Figure 3).

        Figure 3: Stitching OAM at layer requiring L4 to L7 service

   In figure 3, Link OAM is used between any two adjacent SFs hosted in
   the same service node in the SFC layer or between a SF and the
   service node hosting that SF.  NVO3 OAM is used between SFC ingress
   node and NVO3-enabled Network element or any two NVO3-enabled network
   element in the SFC domain.  SFC OAM is used between a set of Service
   Functions belong to the same service function chain in the SFC
   domain.  SF OAM is used between SF and SF Controller.

   When the service packet enters into the network, OAM information
   needs to be imposed by ingress node of the network into the OAM
   packet (e.g., packet header extension or TLV extension in the overlay
   header) and pass through the network in the same path as the service
   traffic and processed by a set of Service Functions that are hosted
   in Service Nodes and located in different layers requiring L4-L7
   service.

   When any Service Nodes or any service segment between two Service
   Nodes fails to deliver user traffic, there is a need to provide a
   tool that would enable users to detect such failures (e.g., fault
   element in the path), and a mechanism to isolate faults.

   In case of several SFs co-located in the same Service Node, the
   packet is processed by all SFs in the Service Node, Once the packet
   is successfully handled by one SF, the packet is forwarded to the
   next SF that is in the same Service Node.

   When the packet leaves the network, the OAM information needs to be
   stripped out from the packet.

   To provide unified view of OAM information from different layers and
   different segment of the Service Function Path, these OAM information
   needs to gathered from various layer using different encapsulation
   and tunneling techniques and abstracted and provided to the
   management application via the uniform management interface.

   As indicated in [I-D.boucadair-sfc-requirements], the following OAM
   functions are to be supported:

   o  Support means to verify the completion of the forwarding actions
      until the SFC Border Node is reached (see Section 3.4.1 of
      [RFC5706]).

   o  Support means to ensure coherent classification rules are
      installed in and enforced by all the Classifiers of the SFC-
      enabled domain.

   o  Support means to correlate classification policies with observed
      forwarding actions.

   o  Support in-band liveliness and functionality checking mechanisms
      for the instantiated Service Function Chains and the Service
      Functions that belong to these chains.

   Other service diagnosis and troubleshooting requirements are
   discussed in [I-D.boucadair-sfc-requirements].

4.4.  Multi-Region Overlay OAM Stitching

   Overlay network is referred to a network that is built on top of
   another underlying network and provides various services(e.g., L2
   service or L3 service) to tenant system.  With the growth of network
   virtualization technology, the needs for inter-connection between
   various overlay technologies/ networks (e.g., VXLAN or NVGRE) in the
   Wide Area Network (WAN) become important since it can provide end-to-
   end connectivity between tenant systems.  Figure 4 illustrates a
   multi-layer network in which data traffic between two tenant systems
   is transported across three NVEs located in three adjacent peer
   regions interconnected using overlay technologies.

               Figure 4: Multi-Region Overlay OAM Stitching

   Link OAM is used between Tenant System(TES) and NVE for monitoring
   the L2 connection between the bridges,IP/MPLS OAM is used between two
   NVEs for monitoring edge to edge connection in the underlying
   network.  NVO3 OAM is used between two tenant systems for end to end
   connection in the overlay network.

   When a packet traverses a set of overlay networks in the data path,
   each overlay network will comprise an overlay segment used to connect
   overlay nodes in the same network and these overlay segment are
   stitched together to form end to end data path ( Figure 4).

   When any Overlay Segment fails to deliver user traffic, there is a
   need to provide a tool that would enable users to detect such
   failures(e.g., fault elements in the path), and a mechanism to
   isolate faults.  It may also be desirable to test the data path
   before mapping user traffic to the Overlay Segment.

5.  Requirements

   This section identifies high-level requirements to fulfill layer
   independent OAM management in Multi-layer Environment to support
   various use cases discussed in the previous sections.

   o  The interfaces between the management entity and each Managed
      device in one administrative domain SHOULD support standards-
      based abstraction with a common information/data model.

   o  The management entity should be able to create a single unified
      view of OAM information that is common to various layers, various
      segment of the same domain.

   o  The management entity should provide an unified management
      interface for multiple OAM technologies that will expose a common
      set of management interface capabilities for different OAM
      technologies (e.g.  Continuity Check(CC),Connectivity
      Verification(CV)).  The management interface implementation will
      convert the defined common management capabilities to the OAM
      technology specific operations.

   o  The management entity should Model OAM operations management and
      represent OAM information and mechanisms in the same way using
      YANG at the management plane to provide consistent configuration,
      reporting, and presentation for the OAM mechanisms.  Specific OAM
      technology models will augment the basic OAM management model
      defined by the LIME Group.

   o  The following capability for layer independent OAM management
      entity should be supported:

      *  Support customized service diagnostic.

      *  Support diagnose the availability of a end-to-end path.

      *  Support diagnose the availability of a segment Path that is
         sub-path of end to end path.

      *  Support verification on the correct value of Path ID between
         any two pair of overlay nodes or any two pair of service nodes.

      *  Support out-band liveliness and functionality checking
         mechanisms for the overlay node or service node.
